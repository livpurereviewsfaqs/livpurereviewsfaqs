=====================================================================================================================

[**Liv Pure**](https://medium.com/@marcinbarrett/liv-pure-elevate-your-lifestyle-with-pure-health-and-wellness-13266f17d47b) is a supplement that works on the root cause of weight gain and stubborn belly fat in any gender. As already mentioned Liv Pure works on improving the functioning of a person’s liver. Now the main question that you might have is how is liver functioning related to weight loss? Let us tell you about it. We all know that the main function of the liver is to remove toxins and chemicals from your body. But what you might not know is that the liver is also the fat-burning furnace of your body. This means that your liver determines if the food that you eat needs to be converted into energy or stored in your body as fat. When your liver is functioning properly, it will burn fat 14 times more efficiently. Similarly, if it does not function properly, it will lead to the accumulation of fat in your body.

The science that tells you how to lose weight is quite simple but the real problem here is to improve liver functioning. This is where Liv Pure comes into play. The weight loss supplement consists of two complexes of ingredients. The first complex focuses on purifying your liver and removing toxins and chemicals from it. The second complex promotes fat burning which optimizes liver functioning and regulates weight loss. Along with promoting weight loss, these ingredients of the supplement also increase your energy levels and improve your overall well-being.
